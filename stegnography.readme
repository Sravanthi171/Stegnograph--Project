1. Project Title and Description

What it includes:
The project's name (e.g., "Image Steganography with LSB").
A brief, clear description (e.g., "This project implements image steganography, allowing you to hide secret text messages within digital images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method.").

2.## Technologies Used

-   **Python:** The programming language used for implementation.
-   **Pillow (PIL):** For image manipulation.
- **io**: Used for working with byte data.
-   **Google Colaboratory:** The development environment used for this project.
- **google.colab.files**: Used for uploading and downloading files.
- **IPython**: Used for displaying images and for cell execution.

3.Key Features

-   **Encoding:** Embeds a text message into a digital image.
-   **Decoding:** Extracts the hidden text message from an encoded image.
-   **LSB Method:** Utilizes the Least Significant Bit method for steganography.
-   **Robustness:** Employs a length prefix to ensure reliable message decoding.
-   **Image Integrity:** The encoded image remains visually unchanged.
- **Adaptable**: The program works with any input image.



4.## Future Scope

-   **Increased Capacity:** Implement methods to hide more data per image.
-   **Enhanced Robustness:** Make hidden data resistant to image manipulation.
-   **Advanced Techniques:** Explore frequency domain steganography.
- **Steganalysis resistance**: Attempt to resist detection techniques.
-   **Encryption:** Add encryption for added security.
- **Improved UI**: Add a user friendly interface.
- **More image formats**: Add the ability to work with more image types.
